Help others without judging them for their actions. Everyone is struggling, and no one earns salvation. Everyone needs all of the Savior's infinite Atonement. It is the Savior's responsibility to heal. The rest of God's children have the responsibility to love and minister in ways that help others draw closer to Jesus Christ.
